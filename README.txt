This is an implementation of Featural InfoWaveGAN model proposed by Begus (2021) on Assamese vowel harmony. The model used for this experiment is a PyTorch version of the original Tensorflow model. The link can be found here: https://github.com/gbegus/ciwganfiwgan-pytorch.git
This work is the first of its kind to model vowel harmony from raw speech. The dataset and the model requirements must be customized to one's needs.
